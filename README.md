# CCRA-BB vs CCRA-WF

In this repo, two algorithms provided in XXX (the paper name will be available later) to solve the CCRA problem are implemented. 

CCRA-BB is the algorithm for finding the optimal solution.

CCRA-WF is an approach based on the Water-filling method to find near-optimal solutions.

Just follow main.py to run the code. 

Note that to run the CCRA-BB part, you need to have a licensed version of CPLEX. Visit their page to get a free license, if you are a student.
